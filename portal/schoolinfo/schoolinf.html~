<h3 style="color:blue;"> School Information</h3>
<p>                    Woodlands Junior opened in September 1964, and caters for boys and girls, aged 7-ll years of age.
 At present, there are approximately 380 children on roll. We have twelve classrooms, an ICT Suite, a library, a hall with 
 fixed apparatus and a wildlife area.  Woodlands is set in pleasant grounds with a large field and an adventure play area.</p>

                 </p>  Class teachers are responsible for the childrenâ€™s welfare and delivery of the curriculum. Work is 
 planned jointly, in Year Teams of three teaching staff with close liaison, communication and support from our teaching 
 assistant team. During planning, Year Teams share the preparation of work, drawing on different experiences, knowledge 
 and expertise to ensure work is relevant and well matched to meet the needs of the children.  In this way, we are able 
 to utilise the strengths of a large staff team and enhance the quality of learning and teaching here at Woodlands.</p>
