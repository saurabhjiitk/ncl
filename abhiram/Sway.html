<strong>WHAT IS SWAY</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong> </strong>
</p>
<p style="font-size:24px;">
Sway is a new app from Microsoft Office that makes it easy to create and share interactive reports, personal stories, presentations, and more.
<p style="font-size:24px;">
Start by adding your own text and pictures, search for and import relevant content from other sources, and then watch Sway do the rest. With Sway, you&#39;re no longer limited to picking a pre-designed template that makes your presentations look like everyone else, and you don&#39;t have to have any design skills to transform and showcase information in modern, interactive, and attention-getting ways.

<p style="font-size:24px;">
With Sway, there&#39;s no need to spend lots of time on formatting. Its built-in design engine takes care of making your creation look its best. If the initial design doesn&#39;t quite match your taste or mood, you can easily apply another or fully customize your layout to make it your own.
</p>
<p style="font-size:24px;">
It&#39;s super easy to share your finished Sways. Family, friends, classmates, and coworkers can see your creations on the Web without signing up, signing in, or downloading anything. And you can change the privacy settings for any Sway whenever you want more control over what you share.

<p style="font-size:24px;">
Sway is free to use for anyone with a Microsoft Account (Hotmail, Live, or Outlook.com). You can create more sophisticated Sways with more content when you use Sway as part of an Microsoft 365 subscription.

	2. Get to know the Sway Storyline
</p>
<p style="font-size:24px;">
   The Storyline is where you type, insert, edit, and format the content that tells your story. Content is arranged in sequential order by adding cards, each of which holds the type of content you want such as text, images, videos, and even Office documents. 
   The order of cards can be rearranged at any time to suit your needs

	3. Give your Sway a title.
</p>
<p style="font-size:24px;"> 
 Click the Title your Sway placeholder text shown in the first card on the Storyline, and then type a short but meaningful description of what your Sway is all about. 
 When you later share your finished Sway, this title will be the first thing that others will see.
